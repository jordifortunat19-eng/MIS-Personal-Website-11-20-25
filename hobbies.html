                    <h2>Spending Time with Friends & Family</h2>
                    <p>
                        One of my greatest joys in life is spending quality time with my friends and family. 
                        Whether it's gathering for a meal, watching a game together, or simply hanging out 
                        and catching up, these moments create the most meaningful memories. Growing up as 
                        a multi-sport athlete, I learned early on that the relationships we build are just 
                        as important as any achievement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Living between Duluth and Burnsville means I get to maintain connections with friends 
                        from both my hometown and college. These relationships have taught me the value of 
                        communication, loyalty, and being present in the moment. Whether we're celebrating 
                        victories, supporting each other through challenges, or just enjoying each other's 
                        company, these connections are what keep me grounded and motivated. My family has 
                        always been my biggest support system, and I cherish every opportunity to spend 
                        time with them, especially during breaks from school.

                    <h2>Cooking</h2>
                    <p>
                        Cooking has become one of my favorite hobbies, especially since moving to college. 
                        It started as a necessity but quickly turned into something I genuinely enjoy. There's 
                        something satisfying about creating a meal from scratch and sharing it with others. 
                        Cooking allows me to be creative, experiment with different flavors, and learn about 
                        different cultures through their cuisines.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Working in fast-food restaurants like Subway and Qdoba gave me an appreciation for 
                        food preparation and quality ingredients. Now, I love trying new recipes, especially 
                        dishes that remind me of home or introduce me to new cultures. Cooking is also a 
                        great way to relax and take a break from studying. Some of my best memories in college 
                        have been cooking meals with friends in our dorm or apartment, turning dinner into a 
                        social event. It's a skill that I know will serve me well throughout my life, and it's 
                        always a hit when I can share a home-cooked meal with friends and family.

                    <h2>Playing Video Games</h2>
                    <p>
                        Video games have been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. They're not 
                        just entertainment for me—they're a way to unwind, connect with friends, and even 
                        learn new skills. Whether I'm playing competitive games that test my strategic thinking 
                        or exploring immersive story-driven games, gaming provides a perfect balance to my 
                        busy schedule as a student and athlete.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Gaming has also helped me develop skills that translate to real life, such as problem-solving, 
                        teamwork, and quick decision-making. Playing online with friends, especially those back 
                        home in Burnsville, helps me stay connected even when we're miles apart. The gaming 
                        community has also given me insights into digital marketing and how brands engage with 
                        audiences—knowledge that could be valuable in my future career in sports marketing. 
                        Plus, as someone interested in sports broadcasting, I appreciate the growing intersection 
                        between gaming and sports, from esports to sports simulation games.

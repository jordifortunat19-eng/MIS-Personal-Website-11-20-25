        <p>Why I chose the University of Minnesota Duluth</p>

                <h2>Why I Chose UMD</h2>
                <p>
                    My connection to Duluth and UMD started long before I was a student here. Growing up 
                    in Burnsville, my family would often take trips up to Duluth during the summer. 
                    Those childhood road trips along the North Shore created some of my fondest memories—watching 
                    the ships come into the harbor, exploring Canal Park, and feeling the cool breeze 
                    off Lake Superior. Even as a kid, there was something special about this city that 
                    stuck with me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I was a junior in high school at Apple Valley, I started seriously thinking 
                    about where I wanted to go to college. I knew I wanted to study business and 
                    marketing, and I wanted to stay in Minnesota but experience something different 
                    from the Twin Cities. My parents suggested we take a trip to tour UMD, and I'm 
                    so glad we did. The moment I stepped onto campus, I could picture myself here. 
                    The campus had this perfect balance—it felt like a tight-knit community, but 
                    it was also part of a vibrant city. The business program had exactly what I was 
                    looking for, and I loved that UMD had strong connections to the business community 
                    in Duluth and beyond.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What really sealed the deal for me was the atmosphere. Walking around campus, I 
                    saw students who seemed genuinely happy to be there. The professors I met during 
                    the tour were approachable and passionate about their subjects. As someone who 
                    values both academics and community, UMD felt like the perfect fit. Now, as a 
                    sophomore here, I can confidently say that my instincts were right—UMD has 
                    provided me with incredible opportunities, great professors, and a community 
                    that feels like home.

                <h2>What I Love About Duluth</h2>
                <p>
                    Duluth has so much to offer, and I've grown to love it even more since becoming 
                    a student here. The natural beauty is incredible—Lake Superior is right there, 
                    and you can't beat the views from campus or the hills around the city. Whether 
                    it's taking a walk along the lakewalk, watching the ships come in, or just 
                    enjoying the fresh air, there's always something beautiful to experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The city has this unique character that I really appreciate. <img src="images/canal-park.jpg" alt="Canal Park Duluth" style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px; float: right; margin: 0 0 1rem 1rem; border-radius: 8px;"> Canal Park is one 
                    of my favorite spots—it's perfect for grabbing food with friends, watching the 
                    Aerial Lift Bridge, or just hanging out. The local restaurants and coffee shops 
                    have become my go-to study spots, and I love how the community supports local 
                    businesses. There's always something happening in Duluth, from festivals to 
                    concerts to outdoor activities, which keeps life interesting even when I'm not 
                    in class.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What I love most is how Duluth feels like a real community. People are friendly, 
                    and there's a sense that everyone looks out for each other. Coming from the 
                    Twin Cities, it's refreshing to be in a place where you can walk around and 
                    actually recognize faces. The city has everything you need, but it's not 
                    overwhelming. It's the perfect size for a college student—big enough to have 
                    opportunities and things to do, but small enough to feel connected and comfortable.

                <h2>Campus Highlights & Personal Experiences</h2>
                <p>
                    My time at UMD has been filled with great experiences both in and out of the 
                    classroom. The Labovitz School of Business and Economics has been fantastic—the 
                    professors are knowledgeable and really care about student success. I've especially 
                    enjoyed my marketing classes, which have given me practical skills I can apply 
                    to my career goals in sports marketing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of my favorite things about campus is the sense of community. Whether it's 
                    studying in the library, grabbing coffee between classes, or hanging out in 
                    the student center, there's always a friendly atmosphere. The campus is beautiful, 
                    especially in the fall when the leaves change, and I love how everything is 
                    walkable. The Kirby Student Center has become a hub for me—it's where I meet 
                    up with friends, study, and sometimes just relax between classes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Balancing school with work at Qdoba taught me a lot about time management, and 
                    I'm grateful for the support I've received from professors and advisors when 
                    I needed to manage both. UMD has given me the opportunity to grow not just 
                    academically, but as a person. I'm excited to continue my journey here and 
                    see where my Business Management and Marketing education takes me.

                <h2>Professional Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Welcome to my personal website! I'm Jordi Fortunat, a determined college sophomore 
                    studying Business Management and Marketing at the University of Minnesota Duluth. 
                    I'm passionate about pursuing a career in sports marketing or sports broadcasting, 
                    combining my love for business with my enthusiasm for sports.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a 3-sport varsity athlete and 6-time letterman from Apple Valley High School, 
                    I've learned the value of teamwork, dedication, and hard work. These experiences, 
                    combined with my business education and work experience, have prepared me for a 
                    career in the dynamic world of sports marketing and broadcasting.

                    <h3>Cooking</h3>
                    <p>
                        Cooking has become one of my favorite hobbies since moving to college. What started 
                        as a necessity quickly turned into a creative outlet and a way to bring people together. 
                        I love experimenting with new recipes, learning about different cuisines, and sharing 
                        meals with friends. Working in restaurants gave me an appreciation for food preparation, 
                        and now I enjoy the process of creating something delicious from scratch.

                    <h3>Playing Video Games</h3>
                    <p>
                        Video games are a great way for me to unwind and stay connected with friends. Whether 
                        I'm playing competitive games that challenge my strategic thinking or exploring immersive 
                        story-driven adventures, gaming provides the perfect balance to my busy student life. It's 
                        also helped me develop problem-solving skills and stay connected with friends back home 
                        in Burnsville, even when we're miles apart.
